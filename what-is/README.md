This talk was broken into four sections:
* A brief introduction by me
* A section by Tara on the FOLIO ILS
* A section by Peter on the FOLIO community
* A section by me on the FOLIO platform

It turned out that we did all the work [in Google Slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1NJ8A1ZF1_JDRbSedSCtNpIW5qJ-7KZrf7M79TLAnzoM/edit#slide=id.p). I exported the final version of the slides [as a PDF](What_is_FOLIO.pdf)
