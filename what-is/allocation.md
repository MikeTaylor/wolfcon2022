In [a Slack chat](https://indexdata.slack.com/archives/C03UC0688KA/p1660560072039479), I invited Charlotte, Peter and Seb:

Hey, folks. As you may know, I am down to run the session What is FOLIO? Three answers at WOLFCon (Wednesday 31 August, 2:45pm for one hour). My session description says:

> We all know that the name FOLIO is an acronym for “the Future Of Libraries Is Open”, but how exactly does FOLIO help to create an open future?
>
> Most obviously, **FOLIO is an LMS** (Library Management System). It provides much-needed competition in a commercial space that has seen fewer and fewer competitors thanks to remorseless consolidation. Because it is open source, and owned by the non-profit Open Library Foundation, the FOLIO LMS can never be acquired, and so will always present a real alternative.
>
> Second, **FOLIO is a community**. Any interested party – library, developer, service provider – can contribute to the direction of the project, sharing insights and best practices, helping to set roadmap priorities, or contributing code and other assets.
>
> Third, **FOLIO is a platform**, providing the UI and backend frameworks for individual modules to run in a shared environment optimized for library applications. (The FOLIO LMS is merely a set of modules running on this platform). The platform is open for use in other applications, such as the ReShare resource sharing suite, and others that we have not dreamed of yet.

I would like to share this session around a bit. I see myself doing a short intr
oduction, then having someone (most likely Charlotte) talk for 15 minutes or so about the FOLIO ILS, then someone else (probably Seb or Peter) talking about the FOLIO community, and then I’ll wrap it up by talking about the FOLIO platform.

Are you available to take on these segments?
