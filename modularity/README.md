I initially put the narrative together in [`modularity-outline.md`](modularity-outline.md), then put the slides together
[in Google Slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1tBI8urMK-MU6w_bjO-cudSo3KySBHuTPjCVB_sP6ECU/edit#slide=id.g1487f437782_0_12). I exported the final version of the slides [as a PDF](FOLIO_modularity_in_practice.pdf)

The Holy Grail image was downloaded as SVG from
https://freesvg.org/chalice
and screenshotted, then cropped and saved as a JPEG
