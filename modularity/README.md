# FOLIO modularity in practice: seamless deployment of modules from multiple sources

[My WOLFcon 2022 talk](https://wolfcon2022.sched.com/event/14ANV/folio-modularity-in-practice-seamless-deployment-of-modules-from-multiple-sources) on Thursday 1 September, 11:30am.

I initially put the narrative together in [`modularity-outline.md`](modularity-outline.md), then put the slides together
[in Google Slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1tBI8urMK-MU6w_bjO-cudSo3KySBHuTPjCVB_sP6ECU/edit#slide=id.g1487f437782_0_12). I exported the final version of the slides [as a PDF](FOLIO_modularity_in_practice.pdf)

The Holy Grail image was downloaded as SVG from

and screenshotted, then cropped and saved as a JPEG
